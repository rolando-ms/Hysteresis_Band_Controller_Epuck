# Hysteresis band controller for Epuck
This is part of my Bachelor's Thesis (2015). The script main_c.c contains my implementation of an hysteresis band controller for the Epuck robot. The inputs for this script are given in the code of [this repo](https://github.com/rolando-ms/TESIS_RMS_FIME.git). 

Given the current position, orientation and desired position, the robot will move accordingly to reach the desired point.
